      <h3>Inventory optimization and strategy with Spirit of '76:</h3>
      <p>I worked with Spirit of '76 in the Summer of 2022. It was a unique
        time for the industry due to covid-19. In 2020, sales were at a near 5
        year low. In 2021, sales reached a record high, and in 2022, we didn't
        know what to expect. Planning during this period was difficult. We had
        expectations that sales would be higher than the previous year but
        only through careful planning. I worked with the Tent Manager to
        provide data-driven inventory orders with a few constraints. The focus
        was to optimize profit. In certain product categories we needed to
        minimize space prodcut took up. In others, we had to ensure we could
        sell enough of the high priced items to justify the cost.</p>
